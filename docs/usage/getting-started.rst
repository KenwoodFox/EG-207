Getting Started
===============

The *Climate Monitoring System* by **Team Gold** is a fully featured scientific climate monitoring instrument,
designed to provide the user with the ability to catalog and record the changes in an outdoor enviorment over
a period of time.

.. warning::
    Before plugging in your CMS please read :ref:`Light Sensor Aperture` first. Failure to do so may put you
    at risk of damaging your CMS.


Getting to know your CMS
------------------------

The CMS is an enclosed unit designed to provide you the user with the ability to record and catalog several
scientific metrics at once. By placing the CMS in some enviorment, you can record the changes that enviorment
undergoes over time.

USB Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your CMS comes equipped with a USB type B connector, used for plugging your sensor into a laptop, desktop or embedded
system.

Light Sensor Aperture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The light sensor Aperture is a component of your CMS used to catalog and sense the presense and intensity of both *UV Light*
as well as *Visible Light*.

.. warning::
    Please be aware, the :ref:`Light Sensor Aperture` may move upon startup, please confirm the following on your sensor
    before turning it on for the first time.

     - Your :ref:`Light Sensor Aperture` is closed and or fully open
     - The space around your :ref:`Light Sensor Aperture` is free of objects or hazards

Temp/Humidity Opening
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The opening on the rear left corner of the CMS allows for air to flow through an internal channel and be read by the sensor within
it is important that this covering is free of debris and is not at risk of collecting debris, especially outdoors.

.. note::
    Your CMS may have come with masking tape covering the sensor opening, it is important to remove this tape before placing the
    sensor into service.


Using your sensor
---------------

Once you've collected your *Climate Monitoring System* and configured your software, proceed to the :ref:`Usage`
section to learn how to use your sensor.
