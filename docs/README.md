Using the documentation
=======================

Storing docs alongside code is a common practice  
in the industry, it allows for syncronous updates  
to both the documentation for a product and the software  
itself, keeping them in sync.


# Getting started with these docs

To build a presenstation, first you must be in this directory

```
$ cd docs
```

all the doc building is automated via Makefile, to build  
all of the presentations for example, run the following

```
$ make pres
```

it will generate all of the presentations in `_build/pdf`
